# In vector_db.py change the __init__ to this to make it run locally.


# When running locally without Docker:

def __init__(self):
        print("📂 Using Local Vector Storage (No Docker)")
        self.client = QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data_local") 
        
        self.collection_name = Config.COLLECTION_NAME
        self._ensure_collection()



# When running with Docker code change:

def __init__(self):
        self.client = QdrantClient(host=Config.QDRANT_HOST, port=Config.QDRANT_PORT)
        self.collection_name = Config.COLLECTION_NAME
        self._ensure_collection()

# Steps to run with Docker:
Open Docker Desktop on your computer and make sure the engine is running.
Open your terminal in the project folder (where docker-compose.yml is).
Run this command:
    docker-compose up -d
Wait 10 seconds for it to start.
Run your pipeline again:
    python -m src.pipeline
